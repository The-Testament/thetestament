# The Testament: A New Foundation for Community and Moral Teaching

**Welcome to the collaborative home of *The Testament*, a foundational text for a new tradition we call *The Path.* Here, we're building an open-source repository of moral teachings, insights, and guidance inspired by the historical figure of Jesus, refocused through a rational, modern lens.**

## Structure

The Testament is organized into three books:

### Book I: Foundations
Establishes the philosophical and historical groundwork of The Path.

### Book II: Principles
Explores core moral teachings and ethical frameworks.

### Book III: Practice
Provides practical guidance for implementing these principles in daily life and community.
