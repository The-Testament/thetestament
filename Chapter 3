#No Miracles or Hell

Picture a quiet street late in the afternoon, a slant of golden sunlight stretching across the pavement. A young man sits on a doorstep, sipping tea and watching neighbors pass by—an elderly woman carrying groceries, a child with skinned knees but bright eyes, a friend leaning in to whisper some small kindness. In this unassuming moment, no angels descend, no fiery threats hover in the sky. Yet the man knows that today matters. The people he cares about matter. The small kindnesses he offers are precious because this life is finite, and every second sparkles with its own worth. He needs no promise of a mansion in the clouds to know that this passing afternoon is already magnificent, and that how he treats others shapes the beauty and meaning of his own journey.

In older times, when knowledge of the world was thin and fear prowled just beyond the dim light of understanding, people clung to stories of miracles and punishments. There was comfort in believing that an invisible hand might intervene if only one held the correct beliefs. There was grim purpose in the threat of a fiery underworld, a looming shadow to keep wanderers on a narrow path. These tales arose in part because human beings yearned for answers—and in an uncertain age, the promise of a grand reward after death or the terror of eternal torment seemed to give life structure and seriousness.

But now, as we’ve stepped into a broader light of learning, we begin to understand that our ancestors used these devices much like a set of training wheels. They served a function when people knew little of the natural world, when stories of thunderous gods and miracles of bread multiplied from thin air helped shepherd frightened hearts toward order and obedience. Fear of punishment and hope of celestial paradise kept many from straying too far into cruelty or despair. But as we advance, we find we no longer need such dramatic tools to guide us. We can stand firmly on the ground of reason and empathy without leaning on supernatural crutches.

Why did all this happen? Consider that in a time before telescopes and microscopes, before the intricate tapestry of human psychology was understood, people reached for stories that offered meaning and control. Threats of a burning hell and the promise of paradise helped explain misfortune, rewarded goodness, and discouraged wrongdoing. Miracles promised that, somewhere, someone was looking out for us, ready to break the rules of nature in our favor. But as we’ve unwrapped the mysteries of the cosmos and learned about ourselves, we’ve seen that these stories, while comforting in their day, can now be set aside. They are not necessary for us to act with goodness and compassion. We can be good because it makes sense here, now, and not for a distant prize in an unknown beyond.

Without the fear of hell or the lure of heaven, we find that every breath we draw is more significant. When we realize that this life may be all we have, every second becomes precious. We do not need to be frightened into kindness by fiery images or bribed by the promise of eternal bliss. Instead, we understand that the joy, sorrow, laughter, and tears we share matter fiercely in their own right. Doing good is not a ticket to a gilded afterlife—it is the soil in which our shared life grows more fruitful and sweet. By choosing compassion today, we enrich the moments we have, turning a simple afternoon or a shy smile into something shining with depth and meaning.

Look at how living this way changes our choices. If our concern is only about a future reward, we might treat the present as a waiting room, something to endure until a heavenly door opens. But if we hold no vision of distant gates, if we hold no nightmares of endless torment, then we discover that it is here, in these mortal moments, that goodness truly matters. We value honesty because a lie darkens the fragile trust we rely upon. We value fairness because an unjust act scars the landscape of our community. We show compassion because another’s suffering tugs at our human heart, and easing that pain is right and good for its own sake.

Freed from fearful doctrines, we can embrace truth more fully. We admit when we are wrong, we learn from our mistakes, and we do not need a dreadful warning to keep us earnest. We cherish love not as a bargaining chip to gain entry into a dazzling paradise, but as the very essence of a life well-lived here and now. From small gestures of mercy to large acts of justice, we do what is right because we understand it improves our shared experience in this finite, wondrous world.

And so we stand at a threshold: the old stories of miracles and hellfire fall away, and we see ourselves for who we truly are—beings with minds that can reason, hearts that can care, and voices that can comfort. We bring goodness to life not to earn a glittering reward beyond the stars, but to brighten the world under our feet. We stand in the golden afternoon sunlight, unafraid of the dark corners of existence, and we say, “This moment matters. I will do good not because I have to, not because I fear a flaming pit or yearn for heavenly mansions, but because when I choose kindness, this life—this precious, fleeting life—becomes richer, kinder, and more meaningful.”

This is why we do not need miracles. This is why we do not need hell. We have outgrown these old devices. We have stepped forward, proudly, into an honest light where the value of life’s every second and the urgency of human connection make us choose goodness freely and joyfully, here and now.
